## AgentUniverse Architecture Design

AgentUniverse is designed with a modular architecture to provide flexibility and scalability. The core components include AgentUniverse Server, AgentUniverse UI, and Conductor. These components work together to provide core workflow capabilities and an OpenAI-compatible large language model interface.

### Core Components

#### AgentUniverse Server

AgentUniverse Server is the core service that provides the main functionalities of AgentUniverse. It handles the execution of workflows, manages the state of tasks, and provides an API for external integrations.

#### AgentUniverse UI

AgentUniverse UI is the web-based user interface for AgentUniverse. It allows users to create, manage, and monitor workflows. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and provides a visual representation of workflows.

#### Conductor

Conductor is the workflow orchestration engine used by AgentUniverse. It is responsible for scheduling and executing tasks within a workflow. Conductor provides a scalable and reliable way to manage complex workflows.

### Deployment Architecture

AgentUniverse can be deployed in various environments, including cloud services and on-premises. The deployment architecture includes the following components:

- **Nginx**: Used as a reverse proxy to route requests to the AgentUniverse frontend and backend services.
- **AgentUniverse Proxy**: Provides external services and acts as a gateway for incoming requests.
- **Tools**: Pluggable components that provide additional functionalities, such as sandbox tools, knowledge base tools, and image processing tools.

### Integration with External Services

AgentUniverse can be integrated with various external services to extend its capabilities. Some of the common integrations include:

- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Used for monitoring the performance and health of AgentUniverse services.
- **VLLM**: Used to deploy and manage large language models compatible with OpenAI's API.

### Conclusion

The modular architecture of AgentUniverse allows for easy customization and scalability. By leveraging core components and integrating with external services, AgentUniverse provides a powerful platform for building workflow-centric AI applications.

## Quick Start

Welcome to Monkeys! This guide will help you get started with Monkeys quickly.

## Using Cloud Services

Monkeys provides an online service that allows you to experience its features without setting up a complete environment. You can register using your email or phone number. New users enjoy a certain amount of free quota to experience Monkeys' features.

## Using Docker Compose

### Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Deploy Core

The core components include monkeys, monkeys-ui, and conductor, which provide core workflow capabilities and an OpenAI-compatible large language model interface.

For detailed documentation, please refer to: [https://github.com/inf-monkeys/monkeys/blob/main/docker/README.md](https://github.com/inf-monkeys/monkeys/blob/main/docker/README.md)

Note:
- Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to route requests to the monkeys frontend and backend, and the monkeys-proxy service provides external services.

#### Step 2: Deploy Tools

In the Monkeys architecture, tools are pluggable components that provide different functionalities, such as sandbox tools, knowledge base tools, image processing tools, etc. You can read [this document](/docs/en/tools/build-custom-tools) to understand why developing custom tools is important.

For a list of tools, please refer to: [https://github.com/inf-monkeys/awesome-monkey-tools](https://github.com/inf-monkeys/awesome-monkey-tools)

#### Step 3: Import Tools into Monkeys Console

- Enter the console and initialize an account by entering any email address.
- In the **Execution Tools** page, click the **Import** button in the upper right corner and enter the manifest address of the tools (format: `http://CONTAINER_HOST:CONTAINER_PORT/manifest.json`).

#### Step 4: Verify Functionality

- Each team will have two default workflows:
  - Multi-turn conversation with a large language model
  - Single-turn conversation with a large language model

- Enter the workflow details
  - Select a model
  - Configure the knowledge base context (optional)

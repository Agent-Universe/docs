## AgentUniverse Core Concepts

AgentUniverse is a powerful platform designed to build workflow-centric AI applications. Understanding its core concepts is essential for effectively utilizing its capabilities.

### Workflow

A workflow in AgentUniverse is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order to achieve a particular goal. Workflows can be simple or complex, depending on the requirements of the application.

### Task

A task is a single unit of work within a workflow. Each task performs a specific function, such as data processing, API calls, or machine learning model inference. Tasks can be configured with inputs, outputs, and parameters.

### Conductor

Conductor is the workflow orchestration engine used by AgentUniverse. It is responsible for scheduling and executing tasks within a workflow. Conductor provides a scalable and reliable way to manage complex workflows.

### AgentUniverse Server

AgentUniverse Server is the core service that provides the main functionalities of AgentUniverse. It handles the execution of workflows, manages the state of tasks, and provides an API for external integrations.

### AgentUniverse UI

AgentUniverse UI is the web-based user interface for AgentUniverse. It allows users to create, manage, and monitor workflows. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and provides a visual representation of workflows.

### Tools

Tools in AgentUniverse are pluggable components that provide additional functionalities. Examples of tools include sandbox tools, knowledge base tools, and image processing tools. Tools can be easily integrated into workflows to extend their capabilities.

### Integration

AgentUniverse can be integrated with various external services to extend its capabilities. Common integrations include Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring, VLLM for managing large language models, and third-party APIs for additional functionalities.

### Conclusion

Understanding these core concepts is crucial for effectively using AgentUniverse to build workflow-centric AI applications. By leveraging workflows, tasks, and integrations, AgentUniverse provides a powerful platform for creating complex and scalable AI solutions.

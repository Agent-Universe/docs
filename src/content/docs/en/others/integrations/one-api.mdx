This document describes how to integrate AgentUniverse' OpenAI-compatible large language model interface into [One API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api). For installation instructions of One API, please refer to its official documentation.

### 1. Create a large language model workflow in the AgentUniverse console

For detailed steps on creating a workflow, see [Built-in Tools (Large Language Models)](/docs/en/tools/builtin-tools-large-language-models).

There are a few points to note:

1. Select the model you need to use. Here we choose `alpindale/c4ai-command-r-plus-GPTQ`.

![Select Model](~/assets/others/integrations/lobe-chat/choose-model.png)

2. In the **API Settings** of the **Start** node, set the *Model Name* to the desired model name. Here we set it to `command-r`.

> By default, the `model` parameter of AgentUniverse' OpenAI interface corresponds to the workflow ID. You can modify this value to set the model name. (Model names must be unique within the same team)

3. (Optional) You can set a knowledge base context for this workflow, allowing the large model to automatically use the knowledge in the knowledge base to answer questions.

> For details, see [Built-in Tools (Private Data Search)](/docs/en/tools/builtin-tools-private-data-search).

Here we add a customer service corpus:

### 2. Create a channel

In the **Channels** page of One API, create a new channel and fill in the following information:

- **Type**: Select OpenAI.
- **Name**: Enter any name.
- **Group**: Enter any group.
- **Model**: Enter the custom model name we set above (see step 1).
- **Key**: AgentUniverse' API Key, which can be created or obtained on the settings page.
- **Proxy**: Fill in the address of the AgentUniverse service, without the `/v1` suffix, e.g., `https://ai.infmonkeys.com`.

![Add Channel](~/assets/others/integrations/one-api/add-channel.png)

Click create.

#### Test Channel Connectivity

Click the **Test** button to check if the connection is successful.

### 3. Create a token

In the **Tokens** page of One API, create a new token and fill in the following information:

- **Name**: Enter any name.
- **Model Scope**: Select the model we added above.

![Create Token](~/assets/others/integrations/one-api/add-channel.png)

Click create.

### 4. Call the API

> Modify the API address, token, and model to your actual address, token, and model.

```sh
curl --location 'https://your-one-api-service.com/v1/chat/completions' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxxx' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "model": "alpindale/c4ai-command-r-plus-GPTQ",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, how can i help you today?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is today"}
    ],
    "stream": true
}'
```

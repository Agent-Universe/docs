### Step 3: Add a Text Generation (GPT) Node

Here, we set the Prompt to:

```text
I am a simp dog, pursuing a girl. Please analyze the meaning of her words based on the information I provide and generate a reply that is flattering but not over the top, making her feel comfortable. If you are unsure about what she is saying, reply with "Hmm, okay, I got it, greatüëç". Do not add any meaningless content to the reply, so that others do not perceive you as a robot.

Message from the goddess: ${workflow.input.msgContent}

Your reply:
```
